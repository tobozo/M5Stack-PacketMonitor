A clone of [@spacehuhn](https://github.com/spacehuhn)'s [ESP32 Packet Monitor](https://github.com/spacehuhn/PacketMonitor32) adapted to fit on a [M5Stack](http://m5stack.com) with the [M5Stack-SD-Menu](https://github.com/tobozo/M5Stack-SD-Updater).

This version shows you the traffic of all nearby devices on the selected WiFi channel.
See the [parent project](https://github.com/spacehuhn/PacketMonitor32) for any details on the code, I only adapted this to work with the M5Stack LCD.
